# IPL-WIN-PROBABILITY
#  IPL First Innings Score Prediction (2008â€“2019)

This project predicts the **final first-innings score** of an IPL match using partial match data (e.g., after 5â€“15 overs). The model was trained on IPL seasons from **2008â€“2016** and tested on data from **2017â€“2019**.

---

##  Objective

To build a machine learning model that can predict the **final first-innings total score** based on the state of the match at any point during the innings.

---

##  Dataset

- Source: `ipl.csv` (ball-by-ball IPL match data)
- Total records: `76,014` deliveries
- Columns used:
  - `bat_team`, `bowl_team`, `overs`, `runs`, `wickets`
  - `runs_last_5`, `wickets_last_5`
  - `total` (target variable)

---

##  Preprocessing Steps

1. **Removed irrelevant columns** like `mid`, `venue`, `batsman`, etc.
2. **Filtered** only consistent teams (removed Kochi, Pune Warriors, etc.)
3. Removed first 5 overs (data starts from `overs >= 5.0`)
4. Converted `date` to datetime
5. Applied **OneHotEncoding** to `bat_team` and `bowl_team`
6. Final input feature shape: `21`

##  ML Models Used

| Model               | MAE    | RMSE   |
|--------------------|--------|--------|
| Linear Regression   | 12.12  | 15.84  |
| Decision Tree       | 17.09  | 23.04  |
| Random Forest       | 13.76  | 18.17  |
| AdaBoost (on Linear)| 12.22  | 15.80  |

âœ… **Best Model:** `Linear Regression` (used in production)

## ðŸ“ˆ Accuracy Summary

- **RMSE ~ 15.8 runs**: On average, the prediction is off by ~15 runs.
- **Accuracy Estimation:**  
  Assuming max score = 220, an average Â±15 run error means:
  Accuracy â‰ˆ (1 - RMSE / MaxTotal) * 100 â‰ˆ (1 - 15.8 / 220) * 100 â‰ˆ 92.82%
